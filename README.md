## About Me

Hey, I'm Ayham :D A beginner who has just started venturing into the fascinating realm of computer science.  
Iâ€™ve begun my journey with the C language and am currently learning Python,  
exploring its impressive versatility.

## Hobbies & Interests
When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in creative writing and poetry, enjoying the rhythm and depth of language. I also have a strong love for mathematics, and collaborating on programming projects is something I truly enjoy as it lets me learn with and from others.
